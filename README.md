### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning or *re*-learning InfluxDB, GraphQL, Service Workers, CI/CD (in Gitlab), and Vercel. Probably more things.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few things. https://saffron-motion.vercel.app/ is a small side project: a tiny personal productivity app that I'm using while I bootstrap it. I'm planning to add integration with Notion and/or Trello, and automatic generation of statistics and visualizations about how I'm working.
