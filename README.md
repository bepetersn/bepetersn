### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning or *re*-learning GraphQL, CI/CD (in Gitlab), Next.js, and Vercel. Actually, that list is out of date now. But I'm learning a lot... perhaps by the time you're reading this, I will be learning Kubernetes.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few things. 
    - I work at a company called Modivcare, a tech-enabled Healthcare Logistics company, on their Connect/Circulation project, providing a sort of Uber/Lyft-like service but for Non-Emergency Medical Transporation (NEMT) -- I support the huge legacy Python/Django monolith that powers the API for this serivce (https://www.modivcare.com/offerings/nemt).
    - https://saffron-motion.vercel.app/ is a small side project: a tiny personal productivity app that I'm using while I bootstrap it. I'm planning to add integration with Notion and/or Trello, and automatic generation of statistics and visualizations about how I'm working.
